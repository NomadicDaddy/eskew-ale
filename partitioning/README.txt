This partition demo has been created to use against the AdventureWorks database and has been tested against SQL Server 2012, 2014, and 2016.

You should run the demo script first. You could execute the whole thing, but what's the fun in that!? Step through and execute in batches so you can get the feel of how it works and deal with any minor issues that might pop up.

After you've gone through the main demo and have two working partitioned tables, take a look at the switch type demos. You should do these in order (0-4) because each expect the tables to be in the same state left by previous step.

Use should have a tab open with show_partitions.sql in it so you can refresh it periodically to get a good visualization of where your data is at that moment.

Please let me know if you find any issues.

Have fun! I enjoyed getting familiar with this topic and hope you do, too!
